                                        One of the most popular types of life insurance is called ‘term’ insurance. This type of policy pays out a set amount, either as a lump sum or a regular income if you pass away within an agreed period (or ‘term’).<br/><br/>                                    The two main types of term life insurance cover are: level-term insurance and decreasing cover insurance.<br/><br/> Level-term insurance covers people for a period of time and typically offers a fixed lump sum of money
                                        to a dependent if you pass away during that time period. You could choose this to ensure your financial commitments, such as childcare costs, can still be paid.<br/><br/> Decreasing cover is a type of insurance that’s
                                        often (but not always) bought to clear a specified debt that itself decreases over time. This type of cover is often taken out to cover mortgage repayment costs.<br/><br/> There are many other types of life insurance
                                        to think about, including critical illness cover and whole of life insurance.<br/><br/>

                                        The level of life cover that’s right for you will depend on your personal circumstances. There are many options including: whole of life insurance, over-50s cover and joint life policies.<br/><br/>

                                            <li>Whole of life insurance – this type of insurance guarantees a pay-out as it covers a person for their whole life. If your health deteriorates then your premium won’t be affected. However, these policies tends to
                                                be more expensive than others.</li>
                                            <li>Over-50s plans – tend to offer a smaller pay-out to cover things such as funeral expenses. The amount you pay for your premium is guaranteed so it won’t go up or down.</li>
                                            <li>Joint life policies – these are often chosen by couples. You choose an amount of cover, which is paid out in the event that you or your partner passes away during the length of the policy. If this happens, then
                                                the policy would then end.</li>

                                        The right level of cover for you will depend on your personal circumstances. Typically, the more cover you take out, the higher your premium will be. However, if you underestimate how much money your dependents will need if you die, then you could leave
                                        your loved ones short. <br/><br/> Some experts say that a cash sum equal to ten times your annual salary is a good starting point. Our easy-to-use life insurance calculator can help
                                        you work out how much cover you might need.

                                        Whatever your age, as an adult it’s always a good time to start thinking about life insurance. In particular people with loans, mortgages and financial dependents should consider getting a life insurance policy. Although it’s common to get a new policy
                                        after a major life event – such as having a baby or moving house – it can be a good idea to buy life insurance sooner rather than later. That’s because providers tend to think of younger people as less risky, as they’re
                                        more likely to be healthy and therefore less likely to claim. So, you could be offered a cheaper insurance premium. There you have it. Whatever stage of adult life you’re at, there isn’t a better time than now to shop
                                        around for peace of mind. Start a quote for life insurance today.<br/><br/>

                                       That’s really up to you and will depend on your circumstances when you’re looking to buy life insurance cover. Paying annually can be a cheaper option as interest could be charged on monthly instalments – so you could save some cash if you can afford the up-front payment. Before deciding on any type of payment plan, you should work out whether or not you’re able to pay in a sufficient amount to cover the duration of your policy.<br/><br/>

Couples without dependents will usually still wish to protect their partner, and some people simply want an inexpensive policy which will ensure that their costs and outgoings can be covered.</small></p>
