                    <p>This Privacy Policy explains how we use your personal data: how it is collected, how it is held, and how it is processed. It also explains your rights under the law relating to your personal data.</p>
                    <p>Veriform Ltd (“We”, “Us”, “Our”) understands that your privacy is important to you and that you care about how your personal data is used. We respect and value the privacy of all of our customers and will only collect and use personal
                        data in ways that are described here, and in a way that is consistent with our obligations and your rights under the law.</p>
                    <p>You have certain rights in relation to your data, including the right to object to processing based on legitimate interests, profiling, and direct marketing. You can exercise your rights at any time by emailing us at info@veriform.co.uk.

                    <h3 id="p2">2. How Our Website Works</h3>
                    <p>If you’d like to request and receive quotes or information for any of our products, you will need to complete and submit the form on any of our websites.</p>
                    <p>Once we’ve received your request, we’ll connect you with one or more relevant Life Insurance Clients (depending on the specific permissions you have given us). We’ll tell the Client who you are, and your product requirements, and they’ll
                        then contact you directly to discuss your requirements and potentially provide you with a quote.</p>
                    <p>You’ll see on any of our websites that we have a clear consent statement. This statement sets out the Life Insurance Clients that will contact you.</p>
                    <p>You can choose which Life Insurance Clients to buy from but you are not obliged to purchase from any of them.</p>
                    <p>We don’t work with any Life Insurance Clients until we have a legal contract in place and have completed a detailed due diligence process. This is to ensure that they respect your data and rights by keeping your data secure and confidential,
                        limiting their use of your data (i.e. to providing you with the requested information), and not sharing your data with anyone else.</p>

                    <h3 id="p5">5. What Is Personal Data?</h3>
                    <p>Personal data is defined by the General Data Protection Regulation (EU Regulation 2016/679) (the “GDPR”) as ‘any information relating to an identifiable person who can be directly or indirectly identified in particular by reference to
                        an identifier’.</p>
                    <p>Personal data is, in simpler terms, any information about you that enables you to be identified. Personal data covers obvious information such as your name and contact details, but it also covers less obvious information such as identification
                        numbers, electronic location data, and other online identifiers.</p>
                    <p>The personal data that we use is set out in Part 6, below.</p>
                    <h3 id="p6">6. What Are My Rights?</h3>

                        <li>The right to access the personal data we hold about you. Part 10 will tell you how to do this.

                        <li>The right to data portability. This means that, if you have provided personal data to us directly, we am using it with your consent or for the performance of a contract, and that data is processed using automated means, you can ask
                            for a copy of that personal data to re-use with another service or business in many cases.
                        </li>
                        <li>Rights relating to automated decision-making and profiling. We do not use your personal data in this way.</li>

                    <p>In order to provide you with our service we pass your details on to one of our Life Insurance Clients so they can contact you by phone and provide you with more information or a quote for Life Insurance. We do not knowingly, deliberately

                        <li>Cookies</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>We do not knowingly, deliberately or aim to, collect personal data from children under the age of 18, either for registration or for marketing purposes.</p>
                    <p>We collect your personal data in a number of ways:</p>

                    <h3 id="p8">8. How Do You Use My Personal Data?</h3>
                    <p>Under the GDPR, we must always have a lawful basis for using personal data. This may be because the data is necessary for our performance of a contract with you, because you have consented to our use of your personal data, or because it
                        is in our legitimate business interests to use it. We collect for personal information in order to provide you with our service and pass your details on to one of our Life Insurance Clients so they can contact you by phone and provide
                        you with more information or a quote for Life Insurance. The information we hold is held securely within an encrypted database and we will only ever transfer your data in a secure way.</p>
                    <p>We take the protection of this data very seriously and will only routinely share data via secure systems with relevant Life Insurance Clients, to progress and conclude enquiries. We may, on occasion, also be legally required to share data
                        with regulatory bodies, including the Ministry of Justice, the Financial Ombudsman Service, the Legal Ombudsman and the Information Commissioner’s Office.</p>
                    <p>Your personal data may be used for one of the following purposes under a legitimate interest or consent basis. The method of communication will be by telephone. The method of communication will be determined by the consent you have provided.</p>
                    <ul> &nbsp;
                        <li>To manage your registration on our websites;</li>
                        <li>Determine whether any of the Life Insurance Clients or approved partners we work with may have services, products and offers that may be of interest to you based on the preferences and permissions you have supplied to us; and</li>
                        <li>With consent, communicate your data to our trusted partners and Life Insurance Clients. You may object to this processing at any time by contacting us on the details provided in Part 14 below. </li>
                        <li>Improve and personalise our website to you, and this could be where we may market directly to you, about other relevant offers that may be of interest to you based on your preferences;</li>
                        <li>Depending on the consents that you have provided and what personal data we hold about you, we may pass your personal data to website sponsors or brand partners (third parties) who may contact you by telephone for direct marketing purposes.</li>
                        <li>For analysis purposes. Where this is done, the information is aggregated and wherever possible anonymised in line with the ICO’s code of practice. These products are of a marketing nature.</li>
                        <li>We may process your personal data ourselves or through third party data processors that will process data on our behalf. We ensure the data processor complies with this policy and all current data protection regulations.</li>
                        <li>Your information will only be released to third parties where you have given your explicit consent, at the time of registering your interest on any of our websites allowing you to fully understand what you are consenting to.</li>
                        <li>If you consent to a call from one of our sponsors or brand partners this will override the TPS.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The legitimate interests can be your interests or our interests. They can include commercial interests, individual interests or broader societal benefits but we need to be able to identify a legitimate interest; show that the processing
                        is necessary to achieve it; and balance it against your interests, rights and freedoms.</p>
                    <p>With your permission and/or where permitted by law, we may also use your personal data for marketing purposes, which may include contacting you by telephone with information, news, and offers on our products and services. You will not
                        be sent any unlawful marketing or spam. We will always work to fully protect your rights and comply with our obligations under the GDPR and the Privacy and Electronic Communications (EC Directive) Regulations 2003, and you always have
                        the opportunity to opt-out.</p>
                    <p>We only ever send personal information to 3rd parties where you have given consent to do so. To prevent fraud and to ensure data accuracy it is necessary to submit your information for verification and filtering. This enables us to provide
                        our services to you, and fulfil our legal obligations. We will take reasonable technical and organisational precautions to prevent the loss, misuse or alteration of your personal information. We will store all the personal information
                        you provide on our secure servers that are subject to strict security requirements.</p>
                    <p>From time to time, Service Providers may return data to us. They may do this if they have a query regarding a request for Quotes that we have sent to them in order to enable us to resolve the query. They may also return data to us, together
                        with confirmation on whether or not a product has been purchased, in order to enable us to improve our marketing.</p>
                    <h3 id="p9">9. How Long Will You Keep My Personal Data?</h3>
                    <p>We have a data retention policy, which clearly sets out how long we keep data for, and for what reasons. We will not keep your personal data for any longer than is necessary in light of the reasons for which it was first collected. Your
                        personal data will therefore be kept for the following periods:</p>
                    <p>We will keep your contact details following an enquiry to any of our websites for a period of 6 months. After 6 months your personal information is placed in a suppression file for a further 18 months. We need to do this to ensure you
                        do not receive any further communication from us or from any of our partners if your information has been supplied to them previously.</p>
                    <p>This enables us to provide our services to you, and fulfil our legal obligations. We will take reasonable technical and organisational precautions to prevent the loss, misuse or alteration of your personal information. We will store all
                        the personal information you provide on our secure servers that are subject to strict security requirements.</p>
                    <h3 id="p10">10. What Are Cookies And How Do We Use Them?</h3>

                    <h3 id="p11">11. How And Where Do You Store Or Transfer My Personal Data?</h3>
                    <p>We will only store or transfer your personal data within the European Economic Area (the “EEA”). The EEA consists of all EU member states, plus Norway, Iceland, and Liechtenstein. This means that your personal data will be fully protected

                    <p>If you want to know what personal data we have about you, you can ask us for details of that personal data and for a copy of it (where any such personal data is held). This is known as a “subject access request”.</p>
                    <p>All subject access requests should be made in writing and sent to the email or postal addresses shown in Part 11. To make this as easy as possible for you, a Subject Access Request Form is available for you to use. You do not have to use
                        this form, but it is the easiest way to tell us everything we need to know to respond to your request as quickly as possible.</p>
                    <p>There is not normally any charge for a subject access request. If your request is ‘manifestly unfounded or excessive’ (for example, if you make repetitive requests) a fee may be charged to cover our administrative costs in responding.</p>
                    <p>We will respond to your subject access request within 28 day’s and, in any case, not more than one month of receiving it. Normally, we aim to provide a complete response, including a copy of your personal data within that time. In some
                        cases, however, particularly if your request is more complex, more time may be required up to a maximum of three months from the date we receive your request.</p>
                    <p>You will be kept fully informed of our progress.</p>
